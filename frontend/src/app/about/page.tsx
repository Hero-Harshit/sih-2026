                  <p>
                    Ayurveda is so much more than a traditional system of
                    medicine. It&apos;s centuries of knowledge, healing
                    practices, and community-held wisdom passed down through
                    generations. Today, passionate innovators, practitioners,
                    and startups are bringing this ancient wisdom into the
                    modern world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But protecting that knowledge and navigating the regulations
                    around it can be incredibly frustrating. The rules for
                    patents, traditional knowledge, biodiversity, and drug
                    compliance are scattered across dozens of different laws and
                    government portals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you don&apos;t have a legal background, figuring out what
                    rules apply to you can feel overwhelming. That&apos;s
                    exactly why we built IP Shakti Sahayak.

                        &quot;Is this already considered traditional

                      Normally, finding answers to these questions means hiring
